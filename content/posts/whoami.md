I am a ethical hacker who loves building websites and coding websites. I have over 60 domain names. I am a cyber security analyst I have been doing coding at an early age. I hack my own websites to see how secure they are to make them more secure.
Remember We are Anonymous. We are Legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget expect us.
